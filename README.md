# DSA-in-C-
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++ refer to the efficient ways of organizing and manipulating data to solve problems optimally. C++ provides various built-in data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and maps, alongside the Standard Template Library (STL), which simplifies working with these structures.
